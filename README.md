
This is the comment system for [my site](http://yccb.me/ "coleman said"), using the isso comment system [here](https://github.com/posativ/isso/), and thanks to [the docker image of wonderfall](https://hub.docker.com/r/wonderfall/isso/).

This is actually a docker-compose solution for any site. Just modify the host param in my config file (currently configured for my test server) and you're good to go.
